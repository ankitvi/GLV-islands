# GLV-islands
Jupyter Notebook accompanying the article "Island Species Area Relationships and the assembly of complex ecological communities" by Ankit Vikrant and Martin Nilsson Jacobi.

# Use:
The notebook (.ipynb file) demonstrates the simulations described in the article for a particular choice of parameters. Other cases can be simulated using parameter choices that accompany the figures within the article. 

In case you discover something interesting (or strange) when exploring other parts of the parameter space (or other functional forms for the immigration term maybe), I would be happy to hear.
